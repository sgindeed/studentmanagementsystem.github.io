					<h3>-----------------------------------------</h3>
					<p>In the past 10 years, students of IEM-UEM are passing out with 1 to 2 jobs per student. The same story
                        is being repeated for the UEM for both its founding batch of 2015 and the current batch of 2016.
                        Students have passed out with 1 to 2 job offers on average. Highest campus offer was Rs 15.5
                        lacs per annum.
                        University of Engineering & Management (UEM) offers higher education courses in Engineering,
                        Management, Medicine and Science. This is a pioneering achievement where an Eastern India
                        based educational institution has established Universities starting from Eastern India to the
                        most Western part of the country.</p>
